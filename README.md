sh.ulse (shack pulse)
==============================================

sh.ulse is a small shell script to stream YouTube videos and offers the possibility to switch of the video output and listen to the sound either locally or over the [shackspace](http://shackspace.de) pulse audio server.


Dependencies
------------

sh.ulse is based on the tool [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl.git) and only offers some convenience in using this tool. Install it using:

    git clone git://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl.git

You also need mplayer to actually play the video/audio but you might already have that ;)
